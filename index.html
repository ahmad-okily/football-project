                <div>
                    <p> In football, the primary objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by getting the
                        ball
                        into their net. The game is played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players, including a
                        goalkeeper. The match takes place on a rectangular field, typically ranging from 100 to 110
                        meters
                        in length and 64 to 75 meters in width, with goals located at either end. A standard match lasts
                        90
                        minutes, divided into two 45-minute halves, with additional time (known as injury time) added at
                        the
                        end of each half to account for delays. The ball used in the game is spherical, typically made
                        of
                        leather or synthetic materials, designed for easy handling and movement during play.</p>
